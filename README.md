# Java Game Engine
A game engine I am working on in my free time!

## How it works so far
#### Rendering Images
We render images by keeping a pixel list of all the pixels on the screen. When we want to draw an image we first get all the pixels from the image then change the specific pixel in our screen pixels list. 

#### Shaders
We have a map of locations and light we want the location to be. We then go to all those locations and make them lighter.

## Game Colllection
I am current have worked on two games. Those are:
- [Frameshift](https://github.com/Avery246813579/Frameshift) - A game with a custom engine I wrote a few years back
- [Solenoid](https://github.com/Avery246813579/Solenoid) - A game I wrote for Ludum Dare a few years back. Also has a custom engine

## TODO 
- Animations
